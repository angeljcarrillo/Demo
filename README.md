## Abstract

We present a quantitative approach to measuring the dissimilarity of curves, using the chain code of slope change. The dissimilarity measure works for both open and closed curves. In order to calculate how far from similarity two curves are, it is proposed to locate the concavity changes in their representation of the chain code of slope change, generating sub-chains along both curves; the dissimilarity value is the average of the differences between the sub-chains, which allows us to grant a continuously normalized value from 0 to 1. To validate our methodology, we used 1400 curves from a public database. For the binary dissimilarity classification task, a recovery (R) of 0.86, a balanced precision (BA) of 0.92 and a precision (P) of 0.87 were obtained. For the trinary classification task, R = 0.77, BA = 0.83 and P = 0.70 were obtained. For the multiclass classification task, the following performance was achieved: R = 0.97, BA = 0.98 and P = 0.95. We conclude our presentation by demonstrating the usefulness of our methodology with two practical applications and its implementation with the extended slope change chain code for future applications.
